# Image-Recognition

# Image Recognition Project

This is a Python-based Image Recognition project using Machine Learning. The project implements image classification using a pre-trained ML model to detect and recognize objects in images.

## Features
- Image classification using Machine Learning models
- Supports various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- User-friendly interface for image input
- Displays prediction results with confidence scores

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd image-recognition-project
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Upload the image you want to classify.
3. View the recognition results and confidence scores.

## Model
- The project uses a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet, or VGG) for image recognition.
- You can replace the model by downloading any compatible model and updating the code accordingly.

## Example
```bash
python app.py --image sample_image.jpg
```
Output:
```
Prediction: Cat
Confidence: 98.7%
```
